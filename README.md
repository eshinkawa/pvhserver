PVH Backend

As request, an expressJS backend service was developed according to this pre-requisites:

## /api/users – save the user
## /api/users – get the list of users
## /api/users/:id – edit the user
## /api/users/:id – delete the user

They were deployed on ``https://peaceful-retreat-27849.herokuapp.com``<br/>

The database used was Firebase, due to the speed and ease of development. <br/>
All services are basically a wrap of the CRUD methods from FB.
